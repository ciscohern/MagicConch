# MagicConch
All Hail the Magic Conch Shell

## Description
MagicConch is a simple Twitter bot that replies back to people that mention it in their 
tweets with simple "Yes, No, Try again" formats. Inspiration comes from the episode 
[Club Spongebob](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob) where you see main 
characters interact with the Conch.
